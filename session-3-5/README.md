# Session 3 - Code Dojo

## The knights journey

A knight on a chessboard starts at the upper right corner (A1) and is moved each turn. It visits each fields on the board exactly once. Write a program which iterates over the possible solutions of the knights journey.

## Goals

While the last dojos our focus was on the way we write the code (TDD), this time we focus on how we order the code into modules (you are of course very welcome to do so in a TDD fashion ;-)). Performance is fun, but secondary.
